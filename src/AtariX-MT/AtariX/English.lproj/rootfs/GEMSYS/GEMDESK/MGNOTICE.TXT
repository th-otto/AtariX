1. What is MGNOTICE ?
---------------------

This little program can draw and manage notes similar to the notes program 
for the Macintosh. The notes are displayed in windows unlike the desktop 
notes in Ease and are therefore independent of the loaded Shell.


2. Installation
---------------

Start manually or load at bootup from the start folder (/gemsys/magic/start). 
All notes will be saved in /gemsys/gemdesk/notice/. This folder will be 
created automatically, if it does not already exist. The INF file will be 
saved in the current directory of MGNOTICE. All files are ASCII (!!). So 
there are no kilobytes of kryptic Binary waste, which have to be thrown away 
with every update. MGNOTICE's window positions are free of rounding errors 
and resolution independent, so there is no mess with different files for 
different resolutions.


3. How to draw notes
--------------------

Select File/New. Type the note and press [Return]. The note will be saved 
immediately. Changed window positions will be saved when the system is 
shutdown. New notes will appear at the position of the input window. The 
position of the input window will be permanently saved in the MGNOTICE.INF 
with Properties/Preferences/Save.


4. Moving the note program to the front and back
------------------------------------------------

Use the MagiC program menu or clicking on a note makes all notes visible. 
Clicking on another program window, or activating another menu bar via the 
MagiC program menu, moves the notes program to the back again.


5. Changing fonts and colours
-----------------------------

Click on a note. The top will turn grey. Select Properties/Font or 
Properties/Colour. The change will be saved immediately. The selected note 
always has a grey top. "Invalid" colours will be shown as black in all screen 
modes with less than 16 colours. Where this is the case MGNOTICE always 
chooses white text. If for example, black text has been selected with a light 
blue background, this will appear as black and white. This will not change 
the original properties of notes. Changing the screen resolution to one with 
at least 16 colours will reveal the original property settings of black on 
light blue again. You can edit the MGNOTICE.RSC colour palette to get your 
preferred own text colours (e.g. light red with light blue etc..).


6. Deleting notes
-----------------

Click on a note. The top will turn grey. Then go to File/Delete... The 
selected window will be closed deleting the note immediately. There is no 
confirmation dialog!


7. Changing notes
-----------------

Click on a note. The top will turn grey. Then go to File/Open... or Double 
click the note. The window size adjusts automatically to fit the new text.

Alternative (emergency):  All files are ASCII and can be edited with any 
editor. Do not change the keywords before and including the line BEGIN. 
MGNOTICE should be terminated before editing notes with an editor the notes 
will be overwritten again!


8. Moving notes
---------------

With the mouse, click/hold on the window and move.


9. Changing Properties
----------------------

Properties/Preferences. Clicking on the Font or Size selection brings up the 
font selector. Clicking on the Background colour selection brings up the 
colour popup. The window position of the dialog will be saved, too.
